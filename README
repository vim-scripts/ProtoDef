You've got a C++ header file and you've got some prototypes declared in there.  Now you need to create some definitions in a C++ implementation file.  What do you do?  Yank and paste?  Naw :)  Use this plugin instead...

The concept is pretty simple: while in the implementation file, you hit a key and all of the currently undefined function prototypes in the header file are automatically pulled in to the implementation file and inserted at the current cursor position.

- Pure virtual functions are ignored
- Functions that are already defined in the header file are ignored
- Free functions are brought in
- Class name is automatically prefixed to member functions
- Constructors and Destructors sort first
- Only the missing items are pulled in so you can use this utility to bring the implementation file up to match the contents of the header file
- However you format the prototype shouldn't really make a difference.  ProtoDef endeavours to reduce all declarations to a canonical form.

ProtoDef can now be found on GitHub: http://github.com/ewiplayer/vim-protodef
